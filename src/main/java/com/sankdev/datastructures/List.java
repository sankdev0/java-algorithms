/**
 * ADT that represents a sequence of elements. This one is VERY important.
 * <br> There are many implementations optimized to make some operations run in constant time.
 * <br> size() - return n, the length of the list;
 * <br> get(i) - return the value xi;
 * <br> set(i, x) - set the value of xi equal to x;
 * <br> add(i, x) - add x at position i, displacing xi,...,xn−1;
 * <br> remove(i) - remove the value xi, displacing xi+1,...,xn−1;
 * <br> Note: these methods are sufficient to implements Stack or Dequeue.
