Brief description

This repo contains demo implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

***
Datastructures

This repo contains some data structure interfaces and their implementations that are largely based
on the book "Open Data Structures" by Pat Morin.
The List, USet, and SSet interfaces described in Section 1.2 are influenced by the Java Collections
Framework. These are essentially simplified versions of the List, Set, Map, SortedSet, and SortedMap
interfaces found in the Java Collections Framework.

TODO list:
- move leetcode.com solutions to another repo
- create a dictionary/map implementation using USet implementation
- includes wrapper classes for making USet and SSet implementations into Set, Map, SortedSet, and
SortedMap implementations.
